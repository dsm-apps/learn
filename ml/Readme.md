Classifier
==========
Naive Base Classifier (Assumes feature values are independent of each other) = Probabblistic Classifier
K-Nearest Classification (Makes no assumption about probability) = Non-Parametric Classifier

Support Vector Machines 
    = SVM / Supervised Learning Model i.e they need training data
    = Do not assume
    = It can work only if there are two labels


Classification
Topic Modelling
Sentiment Analysis
Recommendation
Genere Classification
Quant Trading
et....

Corpus
======
Any data used by ML

Training the Model = Bunch of stuff with the pre-existing data
Running the Model  = Accepting the real data

In the training stage machine will learn from the dat and come up with the model

Classification Problem
======================
The entity that we seek to classify / the input is call "problem instance"
Each problem instance is identified by attributes.
Attributes are called features / feature vectors.

In simple feature is List / Tuble
What is Tuble???

Labels
======
The categories we seek to classify is called labels.
Usually the output is called labels.


An N-Dimensional space can be represented Hypercube
What is Euclidean formula???

ML Techniques
=============
Naive Bayes
K-Nearest Neibhor
Support Vector Machines
Neural Networks
Decision Tree
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression


Clustering
==========
Non-supervised learning
